# Entry Options Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of entry options functionality in the ListLaunchr application, allowing campaign creators to add multiple ways for participants to earn entries.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Entry Actions Component (`/frontend/src/components/giveaway/EntryActions.jsx`)
- **Social Media Follows**: Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok
- **URL Visits**: Custom website/page visits
- **Honor System**: Manual completion tracking (owner verifies manually)
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows completed actions with checkmarks
- **Points System**: Each action awards +1 entry

### 2. Campaign Creation Preview
- **Live Preview**: Entry options now appear in the campaign preview (Step 6)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile preview modes
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes in Step 2 immediately reflect in preview

### 3. Public Campaign Page Enhancement
- **Entry Actions Display**: Shows all configured entry options before email form
- **Action Completion**: Users can complete actions and see immediate feedback
- **Pre-submission Tracking**: Actions completed before email submission are tracked locally
- **Post-submission Sync**: All completed actions are submitted to backend after email entry

### 4. Backend API Enhancement
- **Action Completion Endpoint**: `POST /api/entries/:id/actions`
- **Validation**: Checks if action is enabled for the campaign
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents completing the same action twice
- **Points Tracking**: Automatically updates entry points

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
```
src/components/giveaway/
├── EntryActions.jsx       # Main entry actions component
└── index.js              # Export file
```

### Entry Action Types Supported
1. **visit_url**: Visit a specific URL
2. **social_follow**: Follow on social platforms
   - Instagram (@username)
   - Facebook (page URL)
   - YouTube (channel URL)
   - TikTok (@username)

### API Integration
```javascript
// Submit completed action
entriesAPI.submitEntryAction(entryId, {
  actionType: 'social_follow',
  platform: 'instagram',
  referralCode: userReferralCode
})
```

### Data Flow
1. **Campaign Creation**: Admin configures entry options in Step 2
2. **Preview**: Entry options appear in campaign preview
3. **Public Page**: Participants see available actions
4. **Action Completion**: 
   - User clicks action button
   - Opens social platform in new tab
   - Action marked as completed (honor system)
   - Points awarded (+1 per action)
5. **Backend Tracking**: All actions synced to database

## User Experience

### For Campaign Creators
- Configure entry options in Step 2 of campaign creation
- See real-time preview of how actions will appear
- Entry options are automatically displayed in final campaign

### For Participants
- See all available entry methods before submitting email
- Complete actions in any order
- Get immediate visual feedback for completed actions
- Actions are properly tracked and counted toward total entries

## Configuration Examples

### Instagram Follow
```javascript
entryOptions: {
  socialFollow: {
    instagram: {
      enabled: true,
      username: "@brandname"
    }
  }
}
```

### URL Visit
```javascript
entryOptions: {
  visitUrl: {
    enabled: true,
    url: "https://example.com/special-page"
  }
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Increased Engagement**: More ways for users to participate
2. **Viral Growth**: Social follows help grow brand presence
3. **Traffic Generation**: URL visits drive traffic to specific pages
4. **Flexible Entry Methods**: Multiple touchpoints for user interaction
5. **Honor System**: Simple implementation requiring manual verification

## Future Enhancements
- Automatic verification for some actions (e.g., social API integration)
- Custom point values per action type
- Time-limited bonus actions
- Social share tracking with actual share verification
